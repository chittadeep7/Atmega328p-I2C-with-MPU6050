# This project reads the pitch and roll andle (angle about Y-axis and X-axis) with the MPU6050 sensor using Atmega328p.
The MCU goes to power down sleep mode after the raed operation and wakes up after 16sec using watchdog timer interrupt functionality.
This project was a great learning experience as it combines so many features of atmega into one. In the future I will try to add the complementary/ kalman filter with MPU6050 to see the results.
The project was built using the Microchip studio 7.0.
